TLS website remaster with Next.js + Bootstrap + Sass

# Installation
1. Git clone repository
2. `cd` to this folder directory
3. Run `npm install` via CLI
4. Ignore any npm audit fix requests
5. Run `npm run dev` via CLI

# Getting Started
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# To do
- Replace .css with .sass files
